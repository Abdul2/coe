We can help you find people for user research and usability testing. For example, we can provide lists of potential research participants or help you source new participants. We can also use internal access needs panels to provide contacts for recruitment.

Format: personal advice  
Length: recruiting participants using external agencies can take up to 8 weeks, or 4 weeks if using in-house teams; contacts for recruitment can be supplied within 2 weeks.
