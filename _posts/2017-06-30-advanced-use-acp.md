Learn how to deploy applications in Kubernetes using Drone and ephemeral namespaces. Learn how to create, manage and debug secrets and configs in Kubernetes, deploy locally to Minikube and create and destroy namespaces for ephemeral deployments with Drone and Kubernetes.  

The workshop will also cover how to:
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>dockerise the Hello World app</li>
<li>deploy to Minikube</li>
<li>deploy with a template</li>
<li>deploy to CI Cluster (manually creating a namespace)</li>
<li>add secrets to Hello World, deploying secrets to Minikube and editing secrets</li>
<li>deploy to Cluster, ephemeral namespaces, Drone pipeline set-up with Quay and testing ephemeral namespaces</li>
</ul>

Install Kubectl, Minikube and docker before the workshop and make sure you have access to the VPN.
