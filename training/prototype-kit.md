If you'd like to learn how to use the prototyping kit, so you can easily create clickable prototypes for testing or demonstrating, then join one of our 2 hour sessions and begin to bridge the gap between yourself and a software developer.

In this session you'll learn how to use GitHub and the prototyping kit.
