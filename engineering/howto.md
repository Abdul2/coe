We want you to move fast and start from where others are. No need to re-invent the wheel. Here we will give a good percentage of instructions on how to go about solutioning in the Home Office. We are no different or special and we are not going to coach professionals but we aim to provide you with the right orientation so that you donâ€™t waste time trying to reason with complexity of the Department. 

To start with, we will focus on AWS in a series of publications that will guide you through How to AWS in the Home Office?
