In the past we called this Enterprise Architecture. Unfortunately doing EA did not work well.  Organisations including ours underestimated the level of complexity involved in trying to over engineer ors at industrial scale.  Having said that, we still need somehow to figure out the context.  

Rather than having tools and endless architecting documents, we will only focus on the following areas

an over-view that shows technologies that support service
The Home Office Tech Radar  - see this https://github.com/Abdul2/hotechstack
Performance Indicators 
Repoting 

The intention is to give useful information that helps delivery teams to  appreciate  the delivery context and avoid rework.
